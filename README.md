# kabatree
I hate git stash! use kabatree!!!
kabatree create new branch in another folder.

~example~

npx kabatree newBranch

= git worktree add -b new_branch ../new_branch master; rsync -a -I --exclude='.git' ../AwesomeProject/ ../new_branch

then
cd ..; ls
Wow! there is the branch!

you can commit and push in newBranch!
